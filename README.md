# srPod

This project is a refactored React version of my first web app, which was built as an exercise in vanilla JS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tech

The project uses React for the user interface, and grabs data from the Swedish Radio open API.

The project is published and hosted through Netlify at: https://srpod.netlify.app/
